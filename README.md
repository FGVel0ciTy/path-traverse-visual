## path-traverse-visual
This project is basically a bunch of path searching algorithms visualized. So far you can make paths (place/destroy walls), move the goal/start, generate mazes, and do the searches. The searching algorithms that I have implemented is A*, Dijkstra, Breadth First, Depth First, and Greedy First Searches. The maze algorithms so far is recursive/iterative backtracking and Hunt and Kill.

## Setting Up
You must have a python environment with [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) and the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) modules.

This install line should do the trick: ```pip install pygame numpy```

After that you can just run the main.py file and get started

## Controls
Placing walls - Left Mouse Click

Destroying walls - Right Mouse Click

Moving start - Ctrl+Left Mouse Click

Moving goal - Alt+Left Mouse Click

Changing Algorithms - Right/Left arrow Keys for different search algorithms. Up/Down arrow keys for different maze algorithms
(You can look at the window name to see what algorithms you are using.)
  
Reset Grid - F5

Generate Maze - m

Fast Step (No sleep timer between steps) - s

Start Algorithm - Return or Enter

## Problems
* When there is no path, the program auto closes
* Sometimes PyGame doesn't update so the program will "freeze." Just let it run and the algorithm will finish up and update it at the end

## Future Goals
* Add Play/Pausing (Probably not going to happen atm b/c requires complete rewrite)
* More maze algorithms
* Fix the bugs

## Built With

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - IDE used
* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) - Visuals
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Grid System
